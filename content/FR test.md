## Amplitude
- The higher the amplitude of an RF signal, the stronger the signal strength an 802.11 receiver will see. 
- Amplitude can be increased or decreased by adjusting the output power of the transmitter.

## Phase
- Definition: the relationship between at lease two signals that share the same frequency but have different starting points.
- two signals that have the same peaks and valleys are called **in phase**. If peaks and valleys don't match, they are **out of phase**

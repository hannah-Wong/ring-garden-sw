# Radio Frequency characteristics
## Wavelength
- Definition: wavelength is the distance that a single cycle of a RF signal actually travels.
- *shorter wavelength, higher frequency, means it needs smaller antenna*
- *higher-frequency signals* will generally *attenuate faster* than lower-frequency signals as they pass through various physical mediums, such as brick walls.
## Frequency
- Definition: The number of times per second the signal oscillates.
- 1Hz = 1 cycle per second
## Amplitude
- The higher the amplitude of an RF signal, the stronger the signal strength an 802.11 receiver will see. 
- Amplitude can be increased or decreased by adjusting the output power of the transmitter.

## Phase
- Definition: the relationship between at lease two signals that share the same frequency but have different starting points.
- two signals that have the same peaks and valleys are called **in phase**. If peaks and valleys don't match, they are **out of phase**
